A new intent has arrived for the `booking service`:

Slots that open up less than a day before their start are the best conversion
we have. Once such a slot is open to everyone, push it to the top of public
search results.

Classify this intent against what this product has already agreed, as exactly
one of **extend**, **refine**, **duplicate** or **contradict**. Cite every
requirement id (`R…`) and principle id (`P…`) that bears on the decision, state
what happens next, and say plainly what has and has not been merged.

End your reply with exactly this line, and nothing after it:

VERDICT: <EXTEND|REFINE|DUPLICATE|CONTRADICT>
