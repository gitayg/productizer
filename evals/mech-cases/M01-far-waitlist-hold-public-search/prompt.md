A new intent has arrived for the `booking service`:

Last-minute cancellations are the best conversion we have. The moment an
appointment is cancelled, push that slot to the top of public search results
so anyone browsing can grab it.

Classify this intent against what this product has already agreed, as exactly
one of **extend**, **refine**, **duplicate** or **contradict**. Cite every
requirement id (`R…`) and principle id (`P…`) that bears on the decision, state
what happens next, and say plainly what has and has not been merged.

End your reply with exactly this line, and nothing after it:

VERDICT: <EXTEND|REFINE|DUPLICATE|CONTRADICT>
