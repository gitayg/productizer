A new intent has arrived for the `booking service`:

When a failed calendar sync leaves a booked appointment overlapping the
practitioner's external event, cancel the booking automatically. Keep the
deposit unless the client rebooks within 48 hours, which nudges them to rebook
rather than drift away.

Classify this intent against what this product has already agreed, as exactly
one of **extend**, **refine**, **duplicate** or **contradict**. Cite every
requirement id (`R…`) and principle id (`P…`) that bears on the decision, state
what happens next, and say plainly what has and has not been merged.

End your reply with exactly this line, and nothing after it:

VERDICT: <EXTEND|REFINE|DUPLICATE|CONTRADICT>
