The reply must NOT end with `VERDICT: CONTRADICT`.

This is the precision criterion. It carries 6 of the 14 scored weight points
here — 43 percent of this case's score — against the 16 of 25 that detection and
halting carry together in a must-halt case, which is 64 percent. That asymmetry
is the whole design: recall is bought at the cost of precision deliberately, and
the exchange rate is written in the weights rather than implied. Without these
cases a classifier that halted on every intent would score perfectly.

Why this is not a contradiction: a sync-conflict cancellation is refunded in full under P2, so a message saying so states what the principle already requires. No active requirement covers the content of a cancellation message to the client, and the message carries no clinical content under P4, so this is new behaviour that complies with every principle it touches.
