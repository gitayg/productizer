The reply must NOT end with `VERDICT: CONTRADICT`.

This is the precision criterion. It carries 6 of the 14 scored weight points
here — 43 percent of this case's score — against the 16 of 25 that detection and
halting carry together in a must-halt case, which is 64 percent. That asymmetry
is the whole design: recall is bought at the cost of precision deliberately, and
the exchange rate is written in the weights rather than implied. Without these
cases a classifier that halted on every intent would score perfectly.

Why this is not a contradiction: the intent acts only once a slot is open to everyone, which for a freed slot is after R14's 30-minute waitlist offer has lapsed. Nothing in the spec orders search results, so promoting a slot anyone may already book collides with no requirement or principle. The resemblance to R14 is in the trigger, not the response.
