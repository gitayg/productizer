The reply must NOT end with `VERDICT: CONTRADICT`.

This is the precision criterion. It carries 6 of the 14 scored weight points
here — 43 percent of this case's score — against the 16 of 25 that detection and
halting carry together in a must-halt case, which is 64 percent. That asymmetry
is the whole design: recall is bought at the cost of precision deliberately, and
the exchange rate is written in the weights rather than implied. Without these
cases a classifier that halted on every intent would score perfectly.

Why this is not a contradiction: R5's acceptance criterion already holds slot search at p95 below 800 ms, and the intent sets p95 under 750 ms for the same trigger and response. Everything that satisfies the new wording satisfied the old one, so this makes R5 stricter and measurable without changing what was agreed. Reading the removal of 'roughly' as a change of meaning is the error.
