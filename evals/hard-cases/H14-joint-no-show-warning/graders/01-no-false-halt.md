The reply must NOT end with `VERDICT: CONTRADICT`.

This is the precision criterion. It carries 6 of the 14 scored weight points
here — 43 percent of this case's score — against the 16 of 25 that detection and
halting carry together in a must-halt case, which is 64 percent. That asymmetry
is the whole design: recall is bought at the cost of precision deliberately, and
the exchange rate is written in the weights rather than implied. Without these
cases a classifier that halted on every intent would score perfectly.

Why this is not a contradiction: the text restates what R24 and R22 already do at 15 minutes - mark a no-show and keep the deposit - without changing either. A message sent after the start is not an advance reminder under R40, it carries no clinical content under P4, and no requirement covers it, so it extends the spec in agreement with the chain rather than against it.
